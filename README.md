## NLM / JATS to CrossRef Deposit XML XSLT

## What is this?

This repository contains an XSLT file that will translate [NISO NLM or JATS](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/versions.html)
to [CrossRef Deposit XML](http://help.crossref.org/deposit_schema). It is partially adapted from an XSLT file produced by [PEERJ](https://github.com/PeerJ/crossref-validate). The XSLT file is a prototype and is still under review and development by Crossref staff. We are not actively reviewing comments and issues for this file but will resume work in late 2019.
